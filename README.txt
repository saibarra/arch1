Project 1 was used to test our ability to create a data structure using c. For this project I collaborated
with Lucia Rodriguez, Eduardo Bocanegra, and made use of several references in stackoverflow in order to
get a better understanding of binary search trees in C, along with pointers and creating objects using
struct. Apart from using pointers to reference the memory allocated (malloc), for the nodes and their
data, it was nothing different from the regular version that is implemented in java. I used a simple
interface that requires the user to make a selection of what function they wish to implement. The file
ACME.c originally reads a text file called "names.txt" taht contains a selection of names that is then
placed in alphabetical order using the method "alphabetically" and the displayed when the user makes the
selection. Using the same function that was used to insert names into the binary search tree, we use that
to insert whatever the user inputs after making the selection that a name is to be placed. The final
selection is to exit and just simply breaks from the loop that would keep the user needing to make more
inputs.
